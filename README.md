# 🚀 Ascent – AI driven SaaS for engineering institutes to provision Student Ecosystem

> **Ascent** is a next-generation, AI-powered SaaS platform designed to revolutionize student engagement, institutional efficiency, and career readiness in modern engineering institutions.  
> It transforms fragmented digital systems into a unified, intelligent ecosystem that evolves with each student through their academic journey.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Modern engineering institutions face challenges due to disconnected systems for communication, career services, and academic management — resulting in:
- Low student engagement  
- Heavy administrative workload  
- Poor visibility into student progress  
- A widening gap between academia and industry  

**Ascent** directly addresses these challenges by providing a **single, AI-driven B2B ecosystem** designed around the **four key phases** of a student’s academic journey (FE, SE, TE, BE).  
Each phase progressively **unlocks new tools, insights, and experiences**, ensuring students receive what they need *exactly when they’re ready for it.*

---

## 🌐 Vision

To empower institutions with an **adaptive student lifecycle platform** that dynamically evolves with user behavior and data — fostering engagement, skill growth, and career success.

---

## 🧩 Core Architecture

Ascent is structured around **four progressive phases**, each unlocking more features and intelligence:

### 🩵 **Phase 1: Foundation (FE)**

- **Timeline (DAG)** – Interactive graph of achievements and milestones (Phase 1 node unlocked).
- **BlogPost v1** – Tech newsfeed with AI-curated articles suited to beginner-level understanding.
  - Engagement metrics (likes/dislikes, dwell time) feed into AI for domain inference.

---

### 💙 **Phase 2: Exploration (SE)**
> Encourages student involvement, collaboration, and competitive growth.
- **Club Exploration** – AI-suggested clubs based on domain interests; managed by club admins.
- **Behavior Tracker v2** – Smarter trivia with refined question complexity.

- **Bounty Board** – Micro-challenges posted by clubs (poster design, bug bounties, etc.).
- **Monthly Macrothons** – Lightweight hackathons for consistent practice.
- **Leet Tracker** – LeetCode API integration for tracking problem-solving progress.
- **Timeline Update** – Adds achievement branches dynamically.

---

### 💜 **Phase 3: Growth (TE)**
> Transforms awareness into skill-building and professional readiness.
- **Career Roadmaps** – AI-curated, domain-specific learning and career paths updated yearly.
- **Timeline Comparison** – Compare personal growth with top alumni.
- **Git Tracker** – Tracks contributions via GitHub API.
- **Macrothon v2** – Advanced-level problem statements.
- **Behavior Tracker v3** – Deep data retrieval with domain-focused engagement.
- **BlogPost v3** – Advanced content curated per user domain.

---

### 💚 **Phase 4: Launch (BE)**
> Career readiness, interviews, and specialization culmination.
- **Interview Pods** – AI + peer-based interview simulation by job role/domain.
- **Final Timeline Completion** – All four nodes unlocked with full journey visualization.
- **Leaderboard** – Domain-wise student ranking.
- **Behavior Tracker Final** – Consolidates lifetime data to suggest the most fitting career domain.
- **Skill Tree** – Dynamic visualization of all acquired skills via Skill Log integration.

---

## 🧾 **Default Features (Available Across Phases)**

- **Skill Log** – Students input learned skills, automatically categorized and added to their skill tree.
- **Achievement Hall** – Repository for achievements, synced via LinkedIn API.
- **Data-Driven Insights** – AI models evolve based on behavioral, academic, and technical data.

---

## 🎓 **Institutional Dashboard (For HODs & Admins)**

> Gain a holistic, real-time view of student progress and institutional performance.

### Key Features:
- Phase-wise student list & filtering.  
- Individual student dashboards displaying:
  - Domain interests  
  - Placement/higher study inclinations  
  - Skill tree visualization  
  - Behavior and engagement analytics  
  - AI-powered SWOT analysis  
- Data-driven insights for curriculum improvement and mentorship.

## 🧩 **System Flow**

1. Student signs up → assigned to **Phase 1 (FE)**.  
2. Platform collects behavioral + skill data → feeds to ML model.  
3. As the student advances academically, **Ascent auto-upgrades** their phase.  
4. Each new phase unlocks additional features + complexity tailored to student maturity.  
5. HODs and admins get **live analytics** through the institutional dashboard.
