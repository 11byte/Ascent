      "challenge": "Civilization Resilience Protocol",
      "type": "analytical",
      "prompt": "Develop a comprehensive strategy to protect human civilization against all major existential risks (AI, nuclear war, pandemics, climate change, asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes, etc.) while enabling continued technological and social progress. Design early warning systems, prevention mechanisms, response protocols, and recovery capabilities. Address international coordination, resource allocation, technological solutions, and governance structures. How would you balance security with freedom, and ensure that protection systems don't become threats themselves? Consider both Earth-based resilience and space-based backup systems."
